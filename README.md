# ENGG1000 Project - Robot Rescue - Semester 1 2017

The ENGG1000 Project related to Computer Science and Software Engineering involved creating an autonomous robot to traverse a maze and rescue a victim. This was done by building a robot using a Lego Mindstorms EV3 kit, while programming it with the python ev3dev module.

As a precedent to the final assignment, a Robot Sumo competition was held, where the robot was programmed to fight against another robot and push them out of a ring.
